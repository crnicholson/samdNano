The samdNano+ is based on the Arduino Nano board. The format was extended to allow for more pins to be broken out. It uses the powerful SAMD21G18A chip that is significantly faster and more powerful than the Arduino Nano. It boasts extra pins just for SPI and I2C, while additionally the option to disable LEDs and the power regulator for ultra-low power performance.
